## WORKING WITH CSV FILES ##
############################
# STEP A: Load the DATA


#1/  Use GUI  to open file

for (x in dt)
{
  if (x.!isnumeric)
}

#2/ # traditional # Load csv files using read.csv
dt <- fread("C:/Users/jp_w1/Documents/BUS 462/fifa21_male2_V3.csv")
dt <- na.omit(dt)

# header = TRUE is usually ASSUMED, so not strictly necessary

#3 / Using data table alternate - fast and effecient!
dt <- fread("C:/Users/jp_w1/Documents/BUS 462/fifa21_male2_V3.csv")
dt <- na.omit(dt)

#these next 5 rows are not direclty related to the assignment questions, but rather an exercise for me to play around
#and get more familiar with R Studio and data mangagement.

#installing necessary packages like psych, dplyr, and tidyverse. Tidyverse helps with the plots like ggplot and 
#boxplots, for example.

# Question 1: Which player positions do teams value the most? (via wages)
# Question 2: Find what impacts the most valued position’s performance the most 
# Question 3: For the attributes that contribute more to the position’s performance, which part of the world produces 
# players that score higher in said attributes?
# Question 4: What roles players should play based on their stats? (some players play multiple roles)

#the most important variables include position, foot, wage, attacking, crossing, finishing, heading accuracy, short
#passing, volleys, skill, dribbling, curve, fk accuracy, long passing, ball control, movement, acceleration, sprint
#speed, agility, reactions, balance, power, shot power, jumping, stamina, strength, long shot, aggression, interception,
#positioning, vision, standing tackle, and sliding tackle.
